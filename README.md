## OOP Concepts

### 1. [Encapsulation](./encapsulation)
**Description**: Demonstrates how to bundle data and methods together in a class, hiding implementation details.

### 2. [Inheritance](./inheritance)
**Description**: Explains how classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes.

### 3. [Polymorphism](./polymorphism)
**Description**: Showcases method overloading and overriding, enabling objects to take many forms.
